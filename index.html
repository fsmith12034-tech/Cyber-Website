        <h2>1. Integrity</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Integrity is being honest and having strong moral principles, even when no one is watching.</li>
            <li>I learned the value of integrity from my father, who always emphasized accountability, especially when mistakes are made.</li>
            <li>It's important to me because it builds trust and respect in both personal and professional relationships.</li>
            <li>Without integrity, relationships become shallow, and it's hard to be honest with others or yourself.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>2. Empathy</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others.</li>
            <li>My mother valued empathy deeply and showed me how it helps connect with people of all backgrounds.</li>
            <li>It's important because it allows me to communicate with kindness and connect with others regardless of differences.</li>
            <li>Without empathy, relationships break down, and it's difficult to work with or relate to others. People feel isolated and unsupported.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>3. Responsibility</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Responsibility means being reliable and owning your duties and actions.</li>
            <li>I learned responsibility early on by mowing lawns regularly and watching both of my parents prioritize their obligations above all else.</li>
            <li>It's important because it keeps life structured, helps meet goals, and earns the trust of others.</li>
            <li>Without responsibility, failure is almost certain — tasks get missed, and others can’t rely on you.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>4. Growth</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Growth is the ongoing process of learning, improving, and becoming better through experience.</li>
            <li>My value of growth comes from my belief in self-respect — I feel validated only when I know I'm making progress.</li>
            <li>Growth matters because it keeps life fulfilling, helps me adapt, and gives me purpose.</li>
            <li>Without growth, life becomes boring and unfulfilling. It feels like you're stuck in place without reaching your potential.</li>
        </ol>
